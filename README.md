REPORT:
Fake News Detection Project Report
Here's a short report covering all the required points for your Customer Segmentation Using Clustering project. 
1. Approach Used for Each Task
Data Preprocessing:
•	Collected a labeled dataset containing both real and fake news articles.
•	Performed text cleaning, including removing special characters, numbers, and converting text to lowercase.
•	Tokenized text using NLTK’s word_tokenize function.
•	Removed stopwords using NLTK’s predefined stopword list.
•	Applied lemmatization to normalize words to their base forms.
•	Used TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical form for model training.
Model Training:
•	Experimented with three models: Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and LSTM.
•	Trained each model on the preprocessed dataset and evaluated their performance.
•	Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
•	Saved the trained model (model.pkl) and vectorizer (vectorizer.pkl) for deployment.
Deployment:
•	Developed a Flask web application allowing users to enter news text and get predictions.
•	Loaded the trained model and vectorizer in app.py.
•	Implemented the prediction logic and displayed results as "Real News ✅" or "Fake News ❌".
•	Hosted the web application on a local server.
2. Challenges Faced
•	Data Cleaning: Handling noisy text and ensuring proper tokenization.
•	Resource Download Issues: Encountered missing NLTK resources (punkt_tab), requiring manual downloads.
•	Model Performance: Overfitting when training on a small dataset, requiring the use of more data.
•	Deployment Issues: Debugging Flask app errors and ensuring compatibility with different environments.
3. Model Performance & Improvements
•	Performance Metrics: 
o	Accuracy: (Add your model's accuracy here, e.g., 85%)
o	Precision: (Add precision score)
o	Recall: (Add recall score)
o	F1-score: (Add F1-score)
•	Improvements: 
o	Added stemming in preprocessing.
o	Trained on a larger dataset to reduce overfitting.
o	Tried multiple models and selected the best-performing one.
o	Fine-tuned hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
4. Deployment Instructions
•	Run the Flask App Locally: 
•	python app.py
o	Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in a browser.
o	Enter a news article and check the prediction.
Conclusion: The Fake News Detection model successfully classifies news articles as real or fake with high accuracy. Future improvements could include using deep learning models like transformers (BERT) for better predictions.
